				</p>
			<p>
				
				First of all I would like to graciously apologize for the late arrival of this note. 
				As promised I am sending you your ecards code.
				<br /><br />
				My animators and I are about to finish the birdseed animation which will be available to be sent by 9pm tonight, California time.
				<br /><br />
				Without your support I wouldn't have gotten this far so I've waived the limitations on how many each of you can send.
				Please feel free to send as many as you wish. We've created a version in which the birds spell the word "peace" in four different languages (Spanish, English, Mandarin and Arabic.) so spread the message as far as you can.
				<br /><br />
				To conclude I want to express my full gratitude with a huge "Thank you!"
				<br /><br />
				Your code for the ecards is "birdseed" go ahead and send as many as you want! 
				<br /><br />
				This offer is good for all of our e-cards.
				<br /><br />
				Sincerely yours, 
				<br /><br />
				John Littleboy
